              <p>
                I design complex enterprise products: AI assistants, workflows, document intelligence systems, and operational tooling. I stay engaged until what ships matches what was designed, a distinction that a lot of enterprise design loses between design and production.
              </p>
              <p>
                My background spans B2B SaaS, telecommunications, aviation, and finance: role-based permissions, trustworthy AI, scoping a POC that tests the right assumptions, and design systems that serve large engineering orgs without becoming a bottleneck.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also manage a review program for my agency's finance practice, checking completed work against what's required and leading critique that explains reasoning instead of just corrections.
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't wait for direction: I set the vision, run the workshops, and drive alignment across an organization to get it built.
