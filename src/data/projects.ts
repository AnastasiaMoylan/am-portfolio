    title: "Designing a Governed AI Workspace for Enterprise Finance",
    problem:
      "Finance teams needed AI-assisted analysis without losing the audit trails, governance controls, and human accountability that financial operations require. The risk: ship AI features that feel powerful but bypass controls, and the platform becomes a liability.",
    role: "Lead UX / Product Designer",
    status: "Completed",
    tags: ["AI Interaction Design", "Complex Workflows", "Governance"],
    outcome:
      "Defined a product model that separated experimentation from production, made AI activity inspectable at every step, and gave finance leaders the evidence they needed to trust and approve AI-assisted work.",

  {
    slug: "auditable-billing-workflow",
    title: "Replacing Manual Billing-Package Assembly With an Auditable Workflow",
    problem:
      "AT&T's billing-package process was fragmented across tools, owned by no single role, and had no recovery path when automation failed. Work disappeared mid-process and nobody could tell where.",
    role: "Design Lead and UX / Product Strategy Lead",
    status: "Completed",
    tags: ["End-to-end Flow", "B2B SaaS", "Workflow Automation"],
    outcome:
      "Delivered a first MVP that gave every role a shared view of progress, defined a status model that made ownership and handoffs explicit, and laid a phased roadmap for document integration and full automation.",
    featuredOrder: 3,
    filterCategories: ["Complex Workflows", "B2B SaaS", "Customer Experience"],
  },
  {
    slug: "enterprise-document-knowledge",
    title: "Making Enterprise AI Answers Verifiable Across Complex Documents",
    problem:
      "Knowledge workers were getting AI-generated answers they couldn't verify: no source context, no way to compare documents side-by-side, no path back to the original evidence. Trust eroded fast.",
    role: "UX and Product Strategy Lead",
    status: "Completed",
    tags: ["Document Intelligence", "AI Trust", "Research"],
    outcome:
      "Research showed users preferred side-by-side comparison over tabs, so the navigation model changed based on that evidence. Sourced chat, inline citations, and an embedded PDF viewer kept every answer traceable back to its source.",

  {
    slug: "connected-customer-journey",
    title: "Reducing Churn With a Connected Customer Journey Platform",
    problem:
      "Globe had predictive churn signals but no way to act on them. The gap between a model score and a human taking the right action for the right customer was entirely undesigned.",
    role: "Senior UX Designer",
    status: "Completed April 2025",
    tags: ["Predictive Analytics", "Customer Experience", "AI Decision Support"],
    outcome:
      "Designed an end-to-end mitigation flow that turned a model score into a reviewed, edited, and launched action, with monitoring built in. Human review of AI-assisted messaging was required before anything reached a customer.",
