// Case study content, keyed by project slug.

// Shape follows the Case Study Framework's ten beats, rendered in three acts:
// Frame (snapshot, TL;DR, context) -> Think (evidence, role, decisions, states)
// -> Land (execution, impact, reflection).
//
// Optional fields render nothing when absent, so a study can ship partially
// filled rather than showing empty labels.

// `?preview` yields a downscaled WebP for inline display (see vite.config.ts);
// the plain import is the full-resolution original used by the lightbox.
